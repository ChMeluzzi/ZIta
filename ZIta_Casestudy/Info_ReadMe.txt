#This folder contains the dental affricates produced by 4 male speakers, 2 from Sicily and 2 from Lombardy, in the sentence-reading task
#These data have been published the first time by Meluzzi, C. & Nese N. (2019) "Dental affricates variation in Italian regional varieties: introducing the ZIta corpus", poster presented at XV AISV Congress, 14th-16th February, Arezzo (Italy).

#MATERIALS IN THE FOLDER
#The folder "ZIta_Casestudy_data" contains the audio & Textgrid, divided by speakers.
#The folder "ZIta_Casestudy_analysis" contains tables and values extracted for the analysis of the dental affricates of the 4 selected speakers.


#WARNINGS
#Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 have been annotated by the 1st collaborator Nicholas Nese before the transcription protocol was completed. Thus, these data are annotated slightly different than the rest of the corpus. 
#Speaker 7 and Speaker 8 have been annotated by the author Chiara Meluzzi with a semi-definitive version of the annotation protocol.
#We are working on the re-annotation of speaker 1 and speaker 2 following the final version of the annotation protocol as elaborated at the end of the project.
